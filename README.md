# cmdlinehere
This adds an item named "Command Line Here" to the context menus of folders in Windows Explorer which, when selected, opens a command prompt window with the folder as the current directory.  Under Windows NT/2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008

Under Windows NT/2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008

By default, it uses %SystemRoot%system32cmd.exe as the command interpreter.

Under Windows '95/98/ME/

By default, it uses c:\windows\command.com as the command interpreter.

The orginal mirrors were @ Simtel @ Angelfire and orginal website http://cmdlinehere.blogspot.com & http://www.angelfire.com/electronic/jademan/cmdline/index.htm

But over the years I have not had time to maintain and although it just a installer with registry file
I recently came across the orginal files and plan to host them here. At testing with the install it worked from windows '95 way up to Windows 2008 and only recently did I see if it installed ok on Windows 10 and it does. 

So yes a 10 year old idea which I forgot about that is still downloadable from the orginal Angelfire website.
