# cmdlinehere
This adds an item named "Command Line Here" to the context menus of folders in Windows Explorer which, when selected, opens a command prompt window with the folder as the current directory.  Under Windows NT/2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008/Windows 10

Under Windows NT/2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008/Windows 10

By default, it uses %SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe as the command interpreter.

Under Windows '95,98,ME

By default, it uses c:\windows\command.com as the command interpreter.

The original mirrors were @ Simtel @ Angelfire and original website http://cmdlinehere.blogspot.com & http://www.angelfire.com/electronic/jademan/cmdline/index.htm

But over the years I have not had time to maintain and although it just a installer with registry file
I recently came across the original files and plan to host them here. At testing with the install it worked from windows '95 way up to Windows 2008 and only recently did I see if it installed ok on Windows 10 and it does. 

So yes a 10 year old idea which I forgot about that is still download from the original Angelfire website.

File names

README.md - is this file
Readme.txt - is the original readme file from the cmdline.zip file
cmdline.zip - is the original archive you would download
pad_file.* - the htm and xml are what you needed for Simtel back in the day.
Setup.exe - the original installer file

Planned update to this is when I locate the original Inno Setup file for the installer.
